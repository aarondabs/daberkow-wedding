    story:      `It all started in the romantic Health and Fitness Center at Union Pacific. Aaron would come
                 in every day around lunch time to work out while I was working. I thought he was cute, pretty
                 much the first day I saw him (mustache and all). For FOUR months, I would attempt - and 
                 usually fail miserably, to flirt with Aaron before getting to see him outside the gym. We 
                 finally hung out for the first time outside of work with mutual friends and hit it off 
                 immediately. We ended up ditching our friends pretty quickly to spend the rest of the day 
                 together. Aaron then asked me out on our first date and we were inseparable the rest of the 
                 summer! After an amazing summer together, I moved to Texas to pursue my masters degree in Public 
                 Health. Distance was definitely not easy, but we made the most of it. Aaron was so supportive 
                 throughout my two years in school and I couldnâ€™t have asked for anyone better to help me through 
                 it. We would meet in Oklahoma City (the halfway point between Omaha and College Station) multiple 
                 times throughout the two years. We would each drive 7 hours just to see each other for less than 
                 48 hours. It was not ideal but it only made our relationship stronger!  After I graduated, I moved 
                 back to Omaha and the rest is history!`,
                
    proposal:   `As most people know, Aaron is a planner, so the proposal was nothing short of that. Aaron
                started looking for rings back in August and when I was in Texas for a weekend in September,
                he drove to Topeka, KS to take my parents out to dinner and ask them for permission. (soo
                cute) FINALLY, on Friday December 14, Aaron proposed!! We had a date night already planned
                and before going to dinner we played with our pups in the backyard. While we were in the
                backyard, Aaron pulled out the ring and popped the question! It was absolutely perfect! We
                cannot wait for September 6, 2019 and hope you all can join us!`
